BEIPIR Master Key v3: updated 01/26/23
2/2/23 from Kath

Attached please find the Specific Aims from our original application
Letitia is looking at interactions between other secondary complications through her supplement

Tracking things such as admission and LOS are very complex with the VA EHR and beyond the scope of the current study.


Dear Jiayang,
Please find the most recent version of our comprehensive cohort data attached - Katie sent a slightly updated version after our large team meeting yesterday.

1st worksheet:  summary info as shown in yesterday's meeting
2nd worksheet: limited dataset with variables of primary interest
3rd worksheet: Baseline visit only
4th worksheet: All visits, all variables.

The Key for the variable abbreviations and categories is on every worksheet except the 1st one
Scroll to the right to see it

Let me know if you have any questions and/or would like to set up a time to discuss before our next large team meeting

Best,
Kath
