AIM 1:
Need to do feature selection for regression
n ~= 97, p = 10k???
SIS - sure independence screening
tree-SIS: run a tree model, look at RSS, low RSS means a variable is more important, high RSS means a variable is less important

Model selection:


-Correspondence Analysis

-Logit regression 
imat -> log(imat/100-imat) ~ predictors, 

-beta regression
EXTENDING THE LINEAR MODEL WITH R 2ND EDITION, check class web page - helps with beta regression


AIM 2:
Random effects vs. fixed(mixed?) effects

-generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM)
