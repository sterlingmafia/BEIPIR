Central Hypothesis: There is an association between muscle composition and genetic profiles
	-Specifically, interested in relationship between IMAT (Intra-Muscular Adipose Tissue) following SCI (Spinal Cord Injury) and DNA variants
	-Some veterans with SCI suffer from recurring PrI, and some are PrI-free. Look for genetic factor.

Idea: incorporate DNA data into extant BEIPIR model to enable identification of intervention pathways

Aim 1: Collect DNA data from 38 individuals with varyind degrees of SCI (A-D rating) for whom we already have IMAT data. Do a differential comparison to find which DNA variants/genes are likely associated to IMAT.
	-Analysis Ideas: regression? CART?

Aim 2: Update and re-validate BEIPIR model with longitudinal, stratified data
	-no idea, need more detail

Supplementary Aim 1: Conduct secondary analysis of previously-collected samples to find genes presented differentially between muscle and blood
	-WHY are we doing this? is the idea the genes will be expressed differently in muscle (due to the IMAT) and blood? Idk enough about biology to understand this
	-no idea, need more detail
	
Supplementary Aim 2: Conduct a secondary analysis of the SCI-PIR database to identify common symptoms and risk factors for PrI post-SCI
	-goal is to eventually a develop an inventory/assessment for veterans living with SCI
	-CART, Factor analysis(PCR/PCA)
	
	
	
Questions about data set:
-Do we have visit dates? not sure it matters, just curious
-For visit numbers (VINO), what do the decimals mean? e.g. subject 7334 has a VINO of 3.6
-how were the cutoffs developed for some categorical variables? E.g. NUTI, PRI
