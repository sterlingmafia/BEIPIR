model vars:
IMAT
-ETHN? unkn has a fatter top than not hs/L
-LOI: Below T6 has clearly fatter top tail
-ASIA: Complete has clearly fatter top tail
-PRI: pre-established relationship to IMAT
-BED: BHPTL has a fatter tail than BSTD with ~50 samples in each
-MATT: potential relationship, but also possibly correlated to bed?
	>yes, look at count thing
-BOI, BLI, VASC, RESP: probably correlated to AGEN, which then correlates to IMAT
-PraH - idk why but fatter tail for IMAT here


PRI
-ASIA: Complete has more PRIs, can test for ind. here
-WCTP: wheelchair type seems related
-CUTP: weirdly it seems not having a cushion induces fewer PRI???
-BED: weirdly having a standard bed induces fewer PRI???
-MATT: standard foam means fewer PRI???
-SHC: more home care = more PRI, but probably people more at risk for PRI have better home care?
-PRFQ: low sample size makes it hard to tell


AGEN skewed
YRIN exponential
IMAT exponential, or chi square maybe?
SYRS bimodal
WT reasonably normally distributed
Ht reasonably normally distributed
BMI skewed
ALBM skewed
HGA1 very skewed or chi squared
HRSC might be normal or skewed

partial correlations:
IMAT vs. YRIN
AGEN vs. HGA1
AGEN vs. YRIN


Conclusions:
log(IMAT)
PRI
~
log(YRIN)
log(AGEN)
log(HGA1)

Logistic vs. Logit
LOGIT
in a linear regression assumes error gives normal distribution which allows Y to vary without bound. However, for things like percentages (1 - 100), there are limits to where Y can vary. 
Use: ln(y/(1-y)) ~ xB + error

LOGISTIC
Use generalized linear model with a binomial outcome

SIS: Show independence screening


SUN'S COMMENTS ON EDA:
15 minutes to talk, time for questions after
~15 pages at about 1 min per pages
-introduce what a violin plot is, how to interpret
-show/summarize the interesting ones
-rather than dot plots (or in addition), use percentages in tables
-show either the important or interesting histograms
-do a pairwise plot, but only include the useful variables
	>put a line in the pairwise plot (something with "panel.smooth"?)
		+pairs(swiss, panel = panel.smooth, lwd = 2, cex = 1.5, col = 4)
		
-for preliminary models, also allow for interactions and see what happens
-try glm with steps and square of variables
	>if it complains, focus on the ones we are finding significant
	>MAKE SURE TO FIX IMAT so it's recognized as a percentage
